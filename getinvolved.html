    <h3>Get Involved</h3>
    <h4>Support</h4>
    <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. 
        Donations are very welcome and are an important <br> way we
         keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community. <br>
        You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s 
        collections. If you have some <br> item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us 
        know by contacting our Collections <br>Department and they will be able to assist you.</p>
    <h4>Volunteer</h4>
    <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays
         in good order and ready for <br> visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including
          getting to see behind the scenes of a <br> working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly 
          lunch where all staff and volunteers come <br>together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.<br>
        You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more <br> about how you can get involved.</p>
    <h4>Internships</h4>
    <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the <br> wonders of 
        nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the <br> museum.
       You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and <br>
       sharing it with the wider community.</p>
